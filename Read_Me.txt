HOW TO RUN PROGRAM

3. Instructions related to game play will be provided in browser window.

HOW TO VIEW THE CODE AND WHERE IS IT?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are a few 'languages' used in this project so it is important to know where everything is located.
NOTE: To VIEW any  - js/html/css file - you must right click the file and choose 'Open with' --> notepad or text editor
JAVASCRIPT - the language used for all of the game logic / visuals and keylisteners inside the game screen
The code files are all located in 'Space Adventure' --> 'scripts'.
At this point - the codes are organized based on their nature.
In 'background_resources' - you will find 'background.js' (for the shifting stars) and 'sprites' (for the loading of sprites)
In 'elements'  - you will find 'enemies.js' (for controlling all of the asteriods and enemy ships and their respective elements)
- you will also find 'hero.js' (for controlling the user controlled space ship and its respective elements)
In 'gameSetUp' - you will find 'menu.js' - in charge of displaying the screens in between game play and also displaying the score 
In 'library' - you will find the library we used in the game - 'easeljs-0.4.2.min.js'

In 'scripts' - not in a file like the other scripts - you will find 'game.js' - in charge of connecting all of the scripts together - can look at it like the 'Main' in Java (but not really)

CSS - not really a language but used for doing the basic layout of the page where game is running.
Only script - 'main.css' is located within 'styles'.
HTML - this in our opinion is the real 'Main', although this is just an analogy - loads all the scripts and sets up the browser page.
